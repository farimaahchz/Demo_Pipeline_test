# Pipeline_demo 

This repository showcases a straightforward data pipeline created using Python in Google Colab. The pipeline exemplifies the process of extracting data from an example amazon_sales.csv dataset, performing data transformation (aggregating total sales per category), and loading the transformed data into a SQLite database.
The pipeline is designed using the Sprint Methodology.

Additional Notes:
The data pipeline is designed to be a basic example and may not cover all the cases.
